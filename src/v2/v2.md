# Version 2

In this version, we want to support the following feature.

```typescript
// Say hi immediately.
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Hello, world!'),  // sync resolve
}).then((message) => {
  alert(message);
});
```

The difference with Version 1 and Version 2 is, in Version 1 we resolved
the promise asynchronously, in Version 2 we want to resolve it
synchronously.

We are using the code `new Promise(executor).then(...)`. It can be
rewrite as

```
// Step 1
let p = new Promise(executor);

// Step 2
p.then(...);
```

The problem of sync resolve in Version 1 is, the execution of `executor`
is already completed in Step 1. It won't work if we try to set the
callbacks (`onFulfilled` and `onRejected`) in Step 2, and try to run a
callback in Step 1.

We need a mechanism that if an execution is completed, call a callback
immediately. If it is still running, wait and call the callback right
after it's completed.

Let's create a tool for it. I'll call it `EventManager` because it'll
sort of manage the "fulfill" and "reject" events and their callbacks
for promises. We can definitely make it part of `Promise` itself. But
separated it out will reduce the complicity of `Promise`, and make it
easier to be understood. Now, let's start with the fulfill case:

```
enum EventType {
  Fulfilled,
  Rejected
}

class EventManager {
  private _state: PromiseState;
  private _result: any;
  private _fulfillHandlers: Fulfill[];

  constructor() {
    this._state = PromiseState.Waiting;
    this._fulfillHandlers = [];
  }

  public setState(state: PromiseState, result: any) {
    this._state = state;
    this._result = result;
    if (this._state === PromiseState.Success) {
      for (const handler of this._fulfillHandlers) {
        handler(this._result);
      }
    }
  }

  public onFulfilled(fulfillHandler: Fulfill): void {
    if (this._state === PromiseState.Waiting) {
      this._fulfillHandlers.push(fulfillHandler);
    } else if (this._state === PromiseState.Success) {
      fulfillHandler(this._result);
    }
  }
}
```

You can try fill the reject case. The final code of `EventManager` is
[here](../shared/EventManager.ts).

Now we can change `Promise` to delegate the management of events and
callbacks to `EventManager`.

```
class Promise {
  private _eventManager: EventManager;

  constructor(executor: Executor) {
    this._eventManager = new EventManager();
    executor(
      (value) => {
        this._eventManager.setState(PromiseState.Success, value);
      },
      (reason) => {
        this._eventManager.setState(PromiseState.Fail, reason);
      }
    );
  }

  public then(onFulfilled: Fulfill, onRejected: Reject): any {
    this._eventManager.onFulfilled(onFulfilled);
    this._eventManager.onRejected(onRejected);
  }
}
```

That's it! We've met the feature requirement. The final code is
[here](./v2.ts).
