# Version 1

Let's start with something easy.

Here's the feature we want to support for the first version.

```typescript
// Say hi after 3 seconds.
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(
    () => resolve('Hello, world!'),
    3000
  );
}).then((message) => {
  alert(message);
});
```

Checking the syntax in
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise),

```typescript
let p = new Promise( /* executor */ function(resolve, reject) { ... } );

p.then(function(value) {
  // fulfillment
}, function(reason) {
  // rejection
});
```

We can get a Promise class like this:

```
class Promise {
  constructor(executor: (resolve, reject) => void) {
    // ...
  }

  public then(onFulfilled, onRejected): any {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The return type of `then` should be `Promise`. But to simplify it in
Version 1, let's make it `any` for now.

Look at the feature requirement at top. After the execution of
`executor` is completed:

1. If `resolve` is called, we want `onFulfilled` to be executed.
2. If `reject` is called, we want `onRejected` to be called.

Let's fill the methods to make it happen.

```
class Promise {
  private _onFulfilled;
  private _onRejected;

  constructor(executor: (resolve, reject) => void) {
    executor(
      (value) => {
        this._onFulfilled(value);
      },
      (reason) => {
        this._onRejected(reason);
      }
    );
  }

  public then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    this._onFulfilled = onFulfilled;
    this._onRejected = onRejected;
  }
}
```

That's it! We've met the feature requirement. Easy, right?

By the end of this version, let's do a little bit refining on types.

```typescript
type ExecutorResolve = (value: any) => void;
type ExecutorReject = (reason: any) => void;
type Executor = (resolve: ExecutorResolve, reject: ExecutorReject) => void;

type Resolve = (value: any) => any;
type Reject = (reason: any) => any;
```

You can try change Version 1 to use the above types. The final code is
[here](./v1.ts).
