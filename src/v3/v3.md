# Version 3

In this version, we want to support the following feature that promises
can be chained synchronously.

```typescript
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Hello');
}).then((hi) => {
  return `${hi}, world!`;
}).then((message) => {
  alert(message);
);
```

In Version 2, `then` returns nothing (or `undefined`, to be precisely).
To make it chain-able, we need to return a `Promise` instance. And that
promise should resolve with the return value of the callbacks.

```typescript
public then(onFulfilled?: Fulfill, onRejected?: Reject): any {
  new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Need to resolve with the return value of onFulfilled.
  });

  // Version 2
  // if (onFulfilled) {
  //   this._eventManager.onFulfilled(onFulfilled);
  // }
  // if (onRejected) {
  //   this._eventManager.onRejected(onRejected);
  // }
}
```

Looking at Version 2 again, the callbacks (`onFullfilled` and
`onRejected`) are passed into the event manage and are invoked by it.
The return value of the callbacks is not collected.

A straightforward idea is to wrap the callbacks, so we can collect the
return value and resolve the promise accordingly.

```
function wrap(resolve, reject, callback) {
  try {
    const callbackResult = callback();
    resolve(callbackResult);
  } catch (error) {
    reject(error);
  }
}
```

Since `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` follows the same chain behavior,
this wrapper will work for both. You can try to wrap the callbacks with
it, and you'll find the feature requirement is met!

The final code is [here](./v3.ts).
